# CS6457-Group-Project - Adamant Animators - Lost and Found

Note: The Unity project sits one level down in the "CS6457 Group Project" directory.

## Initial Scene

`LevelScreen` is the initial scene, and then `Tutorial` for the first time playing or otherwise `Farm1`. At the end of each level, you will be prompted to hit Enter to move to the next level. Otherwise, you can switch between scenes by hitting the `ESC` key, hitting the level select button, and selecting a new level (1-5).
